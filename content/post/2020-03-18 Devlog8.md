# March 18 2020 Eigth Devlog

* Completed Tropy with all images and metadata
* School closed due to Pandemic making things a little difficult
* Museum also closed making gaining more images impossible but we have a decent size already
* Tried using the text data on Monday but ran into problems
* Micah forwarded email giving new instructions on Tuesday
* This made things much easier and I managed to get the text software to work
* Ran the program and it read all the images but had some problems
* I accidently included the images that we took on the back (drawings) and that did not work well
* Back pictures did not get read correctly
* other images also were not read correctly with some Ls being read as H
* Several other images were also not read that well making for a difficult mess
* I plan on running the software again tomorrow without those to make it work better and then do a deep inspection of the excel spreadsheet for typos with the front images as they actually have text
* The biggest issue is the lack of consistency on the cards itself and the software cannot work around that as that is not the softwares problem or function
* Ill look over the results tomorrow and see how to go from there
