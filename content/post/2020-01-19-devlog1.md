* Started working on building my devlog on Thursday and simply laid down the techincal work but stopped after a while as it became overhwleming with all the techincal lingo and I did not want to overwhelm myself 

* Continued working on the devlog today (sunday) and finished setting up the devlog (I think). Ive managed to set up the file and 

* I would like to do my museum work at the Museum of Nature as I currently work there and feel like my conenctions would make working on any future project an easier task. As I am also customed to working at the Museum my experience could come in handy helping anyone who also decides to do their project the CMN. While this project/class can give me the option to build more connections at history or Science and Tech, I still want to further my connections at the CMN and I think working at a place I am familiar with will make things smoother and more managable.

* I also missed class this Monday due to illness but I spoke with a classmate and feel like im all caught up but if I feel confused about anyting I know to simply attend student hours and catch up.

* I completed my profile for github and I am almost complete my account on netlify and so far have not had any difficulties with those aspects. While there was a bit of a learning curve it does become easier once you get practice. I suspect this will be the recurring theme for this course.
