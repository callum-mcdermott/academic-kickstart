# Feb 24 2020 Sixth Devlog

* Created Facebook group to co-ordinate our collections
* Have to figure out what metadata would be ideal for us and someone who would want to view this later.
* Have suggested we all post themes that connect the cards we have and then work to create a themes that can apply to all or the vast majority (material, location, markings are few examples)
* Have not worked on it much right now due to other priorties but should be able to devout quite a bit of time to it this week
* Hope to have One combined Tropy for next week and then we can start playing with the auto transcription. Even if this is not incredibly useful for this project this will give a great opportunity to learn how to do this because this will definetly prove to be useful in the future.
* Was interesting to see how online has changed how museums operate and how this impacts the legacy of colonialism that many European (and even Canadian) museums often are faced with.
* Was also interesting to hear about the presenation on Museum texts. I was amused as during the summer the CMN had an exhibit on Pterosaur and I remember the media people working on the signage. Often what is interesting they will ask the non 'science' people at the CMN to proofread the signage to make sure that is can be understood by someone without a scientific background.
