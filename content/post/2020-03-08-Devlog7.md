# March 8 2020 Sixth Devlog

* Finally agreeed on a universal Metadata after connecting with group
* All of them had some themes that connect them and we went with that
* Narrowed it down to:
1. Borden #
2. Collection #
3. Conserved status
4. Inventory
5. Date collected
6. Date catalogued
7. Item Name
8. Material
9. Condition
10. Marks
11. Location
  
* These are the metadata fields that we agreed with going forward
* The only annoyance I have found with them is their lack of consistancy
* Some categories like material are on 99% of all cards but for some reason some do not
* I have left them simply blank right now instead of putting a N.A. and im happy with that right now and if I do decide to change it will not be too difficult
* Solved the Universal Tropy problem
* Decided to simply create one tropy instead of merging 3 together
* None of us were far on our own tropys and this seemed the easiest option
* I am currently making one tropy on my PC that will act as the tropy for all of our images (simlpy solved through sending me the images)
* I have currently been working on it for around 3 hours total and have got about 200 in the system
* Hardest challenge was figuirng out how to apply my metadata to tropy but your guide was really helpful
* I managed to also add custom label to the custom fields allowing me to truely customize Tropy which is working quite well so far
* Even though these are probably easy tasks I am quite proud of myself for not managing to screw this part up and I am now cruising during the entering of the data as I am quite used to entering Metadata
* It also feels quite nice not using Excel this time :) 
(although for the record I only used it as a mangament software before I could even scan any images or had access to any other software and I have never touched it for management software purposes since)
