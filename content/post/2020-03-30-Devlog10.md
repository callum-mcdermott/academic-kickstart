# March 30 2020 Tenth Devlog

* Created a table of values on excel using metadata made on Tropy
* Turned that table of values into a .csv
* Turned the .csv into a database.db file
* Used datasette to run my .db file through my computer
* Attempted to publish through Heroku but ran into problems
* Python could not find heroku when attempting to publish
* Would prompt with- FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
* Had no idea what to do so emailed the prof and we will attempt to solve it today
* Was very impressed that I managed to get as far as I did
