# March 30 2020 Eleventh Devlog

* Worked with Prof today trying to fix FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
* Error indicates it could not find a file but the .db python and heroku are all in the specified file
* It can load the .db symbolizing that file is working
* I can log into Heroku showing it is installed
* I can make Heroku publish a website independently showing it is working
* I cannot get datasette to publish my .db through Heroku
* Prof and I tried many work arounds but could not understand what went wrong
* We could not figure out why it was not working
* It clearly is a problem with python and Heroku not finding each other which we suspect is due to one piece being moved by windows
* I sent the .db file to the prof and he published it on his computer using Heroku where it is now found
* http://fort-frontenac-excavation.herokuapp.com/CARF/CMH
* Our database is now fully published online for the world to see
* Just seems my luck to naturally break things or for technology to do things to me that no one can seem to understand why it did
* Although the best way to learn is to break things so I look at these events as a blessing and we found a solution so its not the end of the world
